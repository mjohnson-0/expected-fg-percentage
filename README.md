# expected-fg-percentage

**Objective: Developing an expected field goal percentage model to evaluate kickers and inform in-game decision making**

### Analysis

Model building and analysis can be found in `~/Analysis/xFG_analysis.RMD`  

### Production

Production code for general model found in `~/Production/xfg_general.R`  
  * Produces xFG probabilities for all possible kick distances and weather conditions
  
Production code for kicker specific model found in `~/Production/xfg_kicker_specific.R`  
  * Produces xFG probabilities for all possible kick distances and weather conditions for an individual kicker
